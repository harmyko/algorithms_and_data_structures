# Algorithms and Data Structures - Vilnius University

This repository contains my work for the 2nd semester module "Algorithms and Data Structures" at Vilnius University, graded by Jonas Žagūnas.

## lab_1: ADT – Binary Search Tree with Balancing Function
In this lab, I implemented an Abstract Data Type (ADT) for a Binary Search Tree with an additional balancing operation. The project structure includes the following files:
- `BinarySearchTree.c` - Implementation of functions for working with the binary search tree.
- `BinarySearchTree.h` - Description of data types and function prototypes.
- `main.c` - A test program to validate the functionality.
- `Go.cmd` - A script to compile and run the program on both personal and faculty computers.
- `PSP.xlsx` - A document with time tracking form.
- `Makefile` - Compiles the program.
- `ReadMe.md` - A brief description of the first lab in Lithuanian.

## lab_2: 5 Queens on a Chessboard
This lab involves placing 5 queens on a chessboard such that every square is controlled by at least one of the queens. The project structure includes the following files:
- `PlaceQueens.c` - Implementation of functions to place the queens on the chessboard.
- `PlaceQueens.h` - Description of data types and function prototypes.
- `main.c` - A test program to validate the functionality.
- `Go.cmd` - A script to compile and run the program on both personal and faculty computers.
- `PSP.xlsx` - A document with LFF, KPS, DTS, and DFF.
- `Makefile` - Compiles the program.
- `ReadMe.md` - A brief description of the second lab in Lithuanian.
