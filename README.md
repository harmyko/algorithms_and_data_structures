# Algorithms and Data Structures - Vilnius University

This repository contains my work for the 2nd semester module "Algorithms and Data Structures" at Vilnius University, graded by Jonas Žagūnas.

## lab_1: ADT – Binary Search Tree with Balancing Function
In this lab, I implemented an Abstract Data Type (ADT) for a Binary Search Tree with an additional balancing operation. The project structure includes the following files:
- `BinarySearchTree.c` - Implementation of functions for working with the binary search tree.
- `BinarySearchTree.h` - Description of data types and function prototypes.
- `main.c` - A test program to validate the functionality.
- `Go.cmd` - A script to compile and run the program on both personal and faculty computers.
- `PSP.xlsx` - A document with time tracking form.
- `Makefile` - Compiles the program.
- `ReadMe.md` - A brief description of the first lab in Lithuanian.

## lab_2: 5 Queens on a Chessboard
This lab involves placing 5 queens on a chessboard such that every square is controlled by at least one of the queens. The project structure includes the following files:
- `PlaceQueens.c` - Implementation of functions to place the queens on the chessboard.
- `PlaceQueens.h` - Description of data types and function prototypes.
- `main.c` - A test program to validate the functionality.
- `Go.cmd` - A script to compile and run the program on both personal and faculty computers.
- `PSP.xlsx` - A document with LFF, KPS, DTS, and DFF.
- `Makefile` - Compiles the program.
- `ReadMe.md` - A brief description of the second lab in Lithuanian.

## lab_3: Airport Simulation
In this lab, I simulate an airport with a single runway, where landing planes have priority over taking off planes, and study the system's performance under varying load conditions, including wait times and fuel constraints for both types of planes.
- `priorityQueue.h` - Priority queue header file. *(Author: ugva1377)*
- `priorityQueue.c` - Priority queue implementation. *(Author: ugva1377)*
- `BigInteger.h` - Big integer header file. *(Author: emsa0885)*
- `BigInteger.c` - Big integer implementation. *(Author: emsa0885)*
- `airport_sim.h` - Airport simulation header file.
- `airport_sim.c` - Main airport simulation logic.
- `main.c` - Program launch and control logic.
- `tests.txt` - Text file with test parameters.
- `PSP.xlsx` - A document with all sorts of nonsense.
- `Makefile` - Compilation instructions.
- `Go.cmd` - Automation script for Windows.


## lab_4: Fastest Route Finder in a Flight Network
This lab implements a flight network simulator that allows the user to find the fastest travel route between two cities based on departure times and durations of available flights. The program supports both default hardcoded test cases and custom input from a file or standard input.
- `flight_graph.h` - Core header file.
- `flight_graph.c` - Core graph and flight management logic.
- `main.c` - Program entry point with default/custom test runners and input handling.
- `Go.cmd` - A script to compile and run the program.
- `PSP.xlsx` - Time tracking and planning document.
- `Makefile` - Compilation instructions.
- `ReadMe.md` - Lab description in Lithuanian.

# And that is all.
